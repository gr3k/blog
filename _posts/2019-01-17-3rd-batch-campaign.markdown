It's been now almost a month that all parcels of Batch 2 have been shipped out. Most of you have already received their Helios4 and **we are starting to see a lot of very positive feedback and nice setup pictures**. There are still some Helios4 parcels out there that are taking their sweet time to reach their destination. Hopefully all Helios4 would have found their homes very soon.

# About Software Support

Thanks to user feedback, we are improving Helios4 software support at each Armbian release and our [wiki](https://wiki.kobol.io) is constantly growing with detailed explanations and instructions. **We can comfortably say that Helios4 software support reached a mature state**. We still have the _Wake-on-LAN_ feature on our TODO list, we hope to have this implemented in the coming days.

Don't hesitate to share your experience, issue or suggestion on the following [Helios4 thread](https://forum.armbian.com/topic/6033-helios4-support/) on the Armbian forum.

# Batch 3 Coming Up Soon !!!

As already quietly announced here and there, **we are preparing for Batch 3!** We will start collecting orders for this new batch next month. It's going to be the same exact pre-oder and pricing model than previous batches with an estimated delivery date of May-June 2019.
