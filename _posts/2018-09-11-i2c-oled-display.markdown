We have updated our wiki with a [new tutorial](https://wiki.kobol.io/i2c/) on how to setup an I2C OLED screen to display your Helios4 System Status.

For this we have developed a rudimentary small application called **sys-oled**. You can find it on our [github](https://github.com/kobol-io/sys-oled).

The setup is pretty straight forward, you will just need couple of jumper wire.

However we are still looking at the easiest way to attached the display to the acrylic casing. We will keep you updated on this matter.

As for the I2C display itself, you can easily find one on Aliexpress.com. Look for "i2c oled 1.3" items.
