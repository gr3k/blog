**Good News ! The manufacturing of the Helios4 Carrier and the A388 2GB ECC System-on-Module is finally completed.** Final step for the factory is to assemble the carrier board with the SoM and the heatsink and then perform FAT (Factory Acceptance Test) which consist of testing all interfaces of each board. Once it's done, all boards will be shipped to our warehouse in Hong Kong.

**Here some pictures of the manufactured Carrier and SoM**

### Shipping will start last week of this month !

The boards should reach our warehouse early next week, then we can start kitting / packing all the Helios4 Full Kit. This last step will take around a week. So **we should be able to start shipping your Helios4 the last week of this month...** as rescheduled :-)

### Last chance to check your shipping address !

This is also the right time for all backers of this 2nd batch to **double check your shipping address.** You can verify you shipping address [here](https://shop.kobol.io/pages/check-order) using your email address and your order number.

If you need to amend your shipping address, send us your request to *support@kobol.io* along your order number.
