It's been a while you have been asking how to run **NextCloud** on Helios4, so finally we just published a **[tutorial](https://wiki.kobol.io/nextcloud/)** on our wiki on how to install NextCloud 13 on a Debian 9 Stretch install.

You will need the following before starting:

* You should have Debian 9 Stretch running on your Helios4 (Ideally the latest image). You can refer to the **[install page](https://wiki.kobol.io/install/)** for instructions.

* You should have setup your storage. Refer to the new **[mdadm page](https://wiki.kobol.io/mdadm/)** for instructions on how to setup a RAID array.
