<h3>The crowd-funding campaign has ended yesterday with a successful goal of 337 units ordered.</h3>


<p>We will focus on a <b>first batch of 350 units</b> with an estimated delivery date of October 2017.</p>


<p>Lately we have been working with our suppliers to start components sourcing in order to launch manufacturing as soon as possible. The PCB board and the SoM (System-on-Module) are obviously the longest lead items, but we are confident on our delivery date target.</p>


<p>We will keep you informed of the manufacturing progress. Meanwhile we will be working on 2 important tasks :<br>
<ul>
<li>Finalizing Drivers and OS support for Helios4.</li>
<li> Writing the Wiki to share all the technical info and guidelines. (including schematics, PCB layout and casing design)</li>
</ul>
<p>

<p>As explained before, this blog will be the place where we keep you updated on anything related to the project, so keep an eye on it. We have setup a mailing list to notify you whenever we have an important news to share. If you are a Helios4 backer you are already in the list, otherwise you can subscribe <b><a href="http://kobol.io/helios4/subscribe.html" target="_blank">here</a></b>
</p>

<p>For the ones who missed the campaign, you still have a chance to grab one of the few remaining kits of this 1st batch <b><a href="https://shop.kobol.io/" target="_blank">here</a></b></p>

<p><b>Thanks again to all of you for your trust and support.</b></p>
