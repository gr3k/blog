### The crowd-funding campaign has ended yesterday with a successful goal of 337 units ordered.

We will focus on a **first batch of 350 units** with an estimated delivery date of October 2017.

Lately we have been working with our suppliers to start components sourcing in order to launch manufacturing as soon as possible. The PCB board and the SoM (System-on-Module) are obviously the longest lead items, but we are confident on our delivery date target.

We will keep you informed of the manufacturing progress. Meanwhile we will be working on 2 important tasks :  

*   Finalizing Drivers and OS support for Helios4.
*   Writing the Wiki to share all the technical info and guidelines. (including schematics, PCB layout and casing design)

As explained before, this blog will be the place where we keep you updated on anything related to the project, so keep an eye on it. We have setup a mailing list to notify you whenever we have an important news to share. If you are a Helios4 backer you are already in the list, otherwise you can subscribe **[here](https://kobol.io/helios4/subscribe.html)**

For the ones who missed the campaign, you still have a chance to grab one of the few remaining kits of this 1st batch **[here](https://shop.kobol.io/)**

**Thanks again to all of you for your trust and support.**
