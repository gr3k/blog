We are going through the **final manufacturing step** : carrier board SMT placement.

Once this is done, each **Carrier and SoM (System-On-Chip) will be assembled together with a heat-sink and tested**. After that everything will be shipped to Singapore for us to finally start the fulfillment of the Helios4 1st Batch.

Some pictures of the carrier board partially populated with components.
