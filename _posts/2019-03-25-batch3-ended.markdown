As announced in previous post, our manufacturing quantity is based on the total number of units we secured during this campaign. However we will manufacture an additional hundred units on top of 400++ units that have been secured. [**So you still have a chance to order Helios4 while stock last !**](https://shop.kobol.io/collections/frontpage/products/helios4-full-kit-2gb-ecc-3rd-batch-pre-order)

**Manufacturing process has started**, all the focus is of course first on the Helios4 carrier + A388 SoM which are the longest lead items.

Will keep you posted on the progress ;-)
