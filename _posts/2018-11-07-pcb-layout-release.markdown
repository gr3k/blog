As you may know by now, **Helios4 is an Open Source project**. In an effort to fulfill the requirements to be considered also as an Open Hardware product, **we have just published on our [wiki](https://wiki.kobol.io/docs/#carrier-board) the PCB layout and BOM (Bill-Of-Material) files**.

[![Helios4 Carrier Files](/img/040/carrier-board-docs.png)](https://wiki.kobol.io/docs/#carrier-board)

The PCB layout was done with Mentor Graphic tools, therefore to open the Helios4 PCB files you will need to download the Mentor VX.2.4 Layout Browser free tool [here](https://www.mentor.com/pcb/downloads/browsers/) (available for Linux and Windows).

Unfortunately the SoM (System-on-Module) around which Helios4 is built is not ours, therefore no PCB layout file will be available for this component. However you can find the SoM schematics on our [wiki](https://wiki.kobol.io/docs/#a38x-microsom).
