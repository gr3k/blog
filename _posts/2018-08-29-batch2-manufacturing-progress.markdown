We are aware that your expectation for Helios4 is going to slowly build-up, so here a first progress update on the manufacturing / sourcing of Helios4 Batch 2.

**All parts which composed the Helios4 Full Kit have been ordered** to the different vendors. Beside the Helios4 PCB, most items will take only 3-4 weeks to get manufactured.

Now regarding the Helios4 PCB (carrier + A388 SoM) which is the longest lead item, we are still waiting some confirmation on the sourcing of some electronic components. So once we have this info **we can refine a bit more our delivery schedule which targets end of October 2018**.

To finish, we know some people are coming in a bit late for this second campaign, but no worry, **there are still pre-order units available**. Just go on our [shop](https://shop.kobol.io/collections/frontpage/products/helios4-full-kit-2gb-ecc-2nd-batch-pre-order) to order one of few remaining units.
