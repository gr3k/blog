We are aware that your expectation for Helios4 is going to slowly build-up, so here a first progress update on the manufacturing / sourcing of Helios4 Batch 2.

**All parts which composed the Helios4 Full Kit have been ordered** to the different vendors. Beside the Helios4 PCB, most items will take only 3-4 weeks to get manufactured.

Now regarding the Helios4 PCB (carrier + SOM), which is the longest lead item, we are still waiting some confirmation on the sourcing of some electronic components. So once we have this info **we can refine a bit more our delivery schedule which targets end of October 2018**.
