## Helios4 Batch 3 is Sold Out !

Last week **we sold the last few remaining units of Batch 3** for which the manufacturing is still ongoing but reaching its end very soon. We are very happy to again reach our target goal, it means there is still a lot of demand for a product like Helios4.

We received many questions regarding a next batch. For now we don't have a plan yet. Once we are done fulfilling Batch 3 then we will communicate our road-map ;-)

## Donation...

As for previous batches, we are also happy to contribute in $ to the Open Source community. **For each Helios4 ordered we donated 1 USD to an open source project**. The Armbian project is cornerstone to the Helios4 project, it was then logical to us to reiterate our support to them.

**So we just transferred USD 540 to the Armbian project ;-)**
