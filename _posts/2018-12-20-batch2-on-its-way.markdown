**Yeah !!! we made it, all orders of Helios4 2nd Batch have been shipped**. Actually it has been already 10 days that all the parcels were handover to the different couriers we used to deliver your orders all around the globe. Some of you already received their Helios4, others might still have to be a little bit more patient. In total we shipped 462 parcels for a total of 550 units of Helios4.

Everything went pretty smoothly, beside DPD courier which struggled to keep up during this peak period of Christmas holiday. Unfortunately most parcel going to Europe via DPD were impacted by the carrier delay. We sent an email to everyone concerned.
