## Introducing new affordable shipping options !

Good news for people in countries for which we were not able to offer our preferred *DPD* and *Seko* shipping options. We are now **offering affordable basic postal service** with *HK Post* and *DirectLink*.

Unless your order is delivered by *DPD* or *Seko*, the taxes and duties won't be included in your order anymore. This means you will have to settle duties and taxes on delivery. Take note that some additional handling fees may apply.

You will see the following details displayed when the taxes & duties are to be paid on delivery.

### Important :

These new shopping options don't impact past or new orders delivered by *DPD* and *Seko*. For those options we will charge the taxes and duties directly, this means NO additional taxes or handling fees will have to be paid by you at delivery.

Now taxes and shipping fees are breakdown during checkout for clarity.

**Note:** For the few backers who already ordered with TNT or UPS shipping options, you can contact us [here](https://shop.kobol.io/pages/contact-us) if you wish to change your shipping options. Please mention your order number when contacting us.


We have also updated the popup that shows during checkout to inform about taxes & duties ;-)

Hope this changes will make everyone happy ;-)

## Campaign progress update

We have already 100 units ordered. Even though there are still 30days to go, we need your help to pass the word around.
