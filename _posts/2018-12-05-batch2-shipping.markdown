Kitting and Packaging have been completed today at our warehouse in Hong Kong, so **we can finally start shipping**. Take note that shipping is always a ramping up exercise, it will take us few days to get all the parcels shipped out. Once your order is shipped, you will received a notification by email with the tracking number.

**Here some pictures of the Helios4 inventory stacking up.**

Hopefully most of you will receive your Helios4 just on time for Christmas. **We would like to thank you again for your patience**. We are fully aware that schedule drifted a bit and we are really sorry about it. With each batch, we are learning a bit more on how to improve manufacturing process and estimating more precisely lead time.

### Setup Instructions

Little reminder, **you will find all the necessary instructions on our [wiki](https://wiki.kobol.io)** along the OS images to download. We are currently working with the **Armbian** team to release new images with latest updates.

So once you have received your Helios4, go to our wiki [here](https://wiki.kobol.io/#where-to-start) to find all the key steps to setup your system.

**Have fun !**
