Visit our **[shop](https://shop.kobol.io/products/helios4-full-kit-2gb-ecc-3rd-batch-pre-order)** now.

## Campaign Goal

We are using the same Pre-order approach that we did for previous campaigns. The goal is to **reach at least 300 units ordered** before starting production. We are planning to manufacture 750 units to have enough inventory for the late buyers, but don't wait too long since the stock won't last.

The estimated shipping date is June 2019.

You will get charged immediately when you order. If the campaign doesn't reach its funding goal by the end date, you will get refunded the whole amount.

**Note:** All orders are proceed in Singapore Dollar (SGD).
