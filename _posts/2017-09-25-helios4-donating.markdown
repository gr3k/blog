You might remember that one of our mottos is **"We Believe in Open Source"**.

Because simply this project wouldn't even exist without all the amazing projects out there, it was always our intention to crontibute back to the open source community in a monetary way.

Taking into account that our crowdfunding goal was downscale, we had to adapt the contribution to the following scheme and focused only on **2 open source projects** that are key to us. For each Helios4 ordered we will **donate 1USD to each of them**.

**So last week we transfered USD 350 (= Euro 300) to each of the following projects :**
