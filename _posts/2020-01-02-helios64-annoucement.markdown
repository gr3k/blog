## 2020 is Helios64 year, the ultimate ARM based NAS board!

First of all, the Kobol Team wishes you terabytes of good things for this new year. We are finally getting close to Helios64 launch and here we would like to officially introduce you our new product and pricing.

You will be able to order each item individually based on your needs or order the full kit bundle and enjoy a discount. Helios64 will be ready to ship end of March 2020, therefore will also offer an early bird discount for whoever order the full kit bundle before that date. **Pre-orders should be opened next week.**

## Helios64 Board

This is our new take on the best ARM based single-board-computer for a NAS solution. Compare to Helios4 this new board offers improvements on every single key aspects : more computing power with ARM 64-bit Hexacore SoC, larger and faster memory with 4GB of LPDDR4, more storage capacity with 5x SATA 3.0 ports, faster throughput with Multi-Gigabit 2.5Gbe Ethernet, wider options with Display Port and Direct-Attached-Storage modes support, and finally safer with a built-in UPS. This is definitively a very unique board which offers built-in features you won't find in any other product.
