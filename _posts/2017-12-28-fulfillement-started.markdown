Yesterday we received from our PCB manufacturer a first chunk of the 350 units batch, just 40++ boards. We decided to **fulfill some orders** for practice. Some lucky backers should have received an email update about their order shipment.

It was a good way to experiment our shipping platform with just a couple of parcels and see what we need to improve/fix quickly in order to fast track the fulfillment of the remaining 300++ units. As announced previously, **fulfillment of the big remaining bulk will start next week**.
