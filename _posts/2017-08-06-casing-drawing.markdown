<h3>If you want to design your own casing, this is the info you need !</h3>

<p>While waiting for the Wiki to be set up, we are sharing the Helios4 casing drawings and the carrier board form factor info.</p>

<p>
<h4>Casing</h4>
There are 2 drawings:
<ul>
<li><b><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/files/Helios4_CaseB_r4b_Drawings.zip" target="_blank">Heliso4 Case Rev.4B</a></b> - The original design as seen during our campaign,</li>
<li><b><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/files/Helios4_CaseB_r4e_Drawings.zip" target="_blank">Helios4 Case Rev.4E</a></b> - The final design that has a 1mm clearing between HDD and side plates for vibration absorption O-ring. Plus a plain area on the front plate for a potential OLED screen.</li>
</ul>
Note: The drawings were made with SketchUp. Each zip also contains an export in DXF and EPS.
</p>

<p>
<h4>Carrier Board</h4>
<b><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/files/Helios4_Mechnical_Assembly.pdf" target="_blank">Helios 4 Mechanical Assembly</a></b> - Overall form factor and mounting holes details.
