### If you want to design your own casing, this is the info you need !

While waiting for the Wiki to be set up, we are sharing the Helios4 casing drawings and the carrier board form factor info.

#### Casing

There are 2 drawings:

*   **[Heliso4 Case Rev.4B](/files/Helios4_CaseB_r4b_Drawings.zip)** - The original design as seen during our campaign,
*   **[Helios4 Case Rev.4E](/files/Helios4_CaseB_r4e_Drawings.zip)** - The final design that has a 1mm clearing between HDD and side plates for vibration absorption O-ring. Plus a plain area on the front plate for a potential OLED screen.

Note: The drawings were made with SketchUp. Each zip also contains an export in DXF and EPS.

#### Carrier Board

**[Helios 4 Mechanical Assembly](/files/Helios4_Mechnical_Assembly.pdf)** - Overall form factor and mounting holes details.

On a final note, all pre-order units are finally **sold out**. If you want to get notified when we will start the second batch, subscribe to our newsletter: **[here](http://kobol.io/helios4/subscribe.html)**
