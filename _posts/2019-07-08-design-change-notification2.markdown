We forgot to share last month about this **additional minor change which concerns all new Helios4 units.**

Due to the discontinuation of some of the power management devices used for production of the ARMADA 388 Rev-2.0 SoM, and due to Marvell move from ARMADA 388 SoC A0 revision to B0, SolidRun Ltd. has introduced a little while ago an updated ARMADA 388 Rev-2.1 SoM which features equivalent power management devices from a different vendor and ARMADA388 B0 SoC revision.

**All Helios4 rev 1.2 and further will be using the new ARMADA 388 Rev-2.1 SoM.**

There is no Electrical, Mechanical, Software or Performance impact arising from this change. You can refer to the PCN document for more info : [here](https://wiki.kobol.io/files/pcn/Helios4_PCN_201906060001.pdf).

We have published the SoM rev 2.1 schematics [here](https://wiki.kobol.io/docs/#a38x-microsom) on our wiki.

This minor change **doesn't have any impact** on certification nor on the ongoing Batch 3 manufacturing process which should be completed in the coming days. ;-)
