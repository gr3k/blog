<h3>This is the final version of Helios4 case.</h3>

<p>In a previous <a href="http://blog.kobol.io/2017/08/06/casing-drawing/">post</a> we shared the Helios4 case drawings. There have been some little modifications to the case to ajust it to the acrylic sheet thickness tolerance we sourced for manufacturing.</p>
<p>Finally we made the design more generic regarding the vibration absorption o-rings that we feel are not very useful. So you have the choice to put or not some o-rings on the HDD screws, in either option the assembly won't be loose.

Note: <i>The drawings were made with SketchUp. Each zip also contains an export in PDF, DXF and EPS. As requested by someone, a SketchUp file of an assembled case was included.</i>
