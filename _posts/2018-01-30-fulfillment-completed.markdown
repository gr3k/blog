After a long week of endless packing, labeling and shipping, we are happy and relieved to say that **all orders have been shipped out** *(Except the bulk order of 94 units from our biggest backer that requires special handling)*.  

Already some of you have received your orders while for the others it should reach your home in the coming days.

**Note:** For any issue related to the delivery of your order contact us [here](https://shop.kobol.io/pages/contact-us).
