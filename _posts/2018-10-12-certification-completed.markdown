We are happy to announce that **Helios4 has successfully passed conformity for FCC and CE standards**. It's a pretty big milestone for any hardware project, and it will give us confidence for future products.

Helios4 is compliant with the following standards :

- FCC Standard :
    * FCC CFR 47 PART 15 SUBPART B Section 15.101

- CE Standards :
    * EN 55032:2015
    * EN 61000-3-2:2014
    * EN 61000-3-3:2013
    * EN 55024:2010

We have published on our [wiki](https://wiki.kobol.io/docs/#certification) the DoC certificates along with the detailed test reports from the laboratory (UCS Lab in South Korea) where we performed the EMC testing.

So now we can apply the FCC and CE label on Helios4 product. This FCC and CE compliance also applies to all the boards of the 1st batch since it's still the same hardware revision.
