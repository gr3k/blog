*Some of you requested their parcel to be shipped only first week of September. Those parcels have been put on hold and you will receive an email as soon as we ship them on that week.*

### About the OLED Display Cable !

To connect the OLED display provided in Batch 3, you will need to use Dupont jumper cables. However in the kit you will find 2 set of jumper cables :

* 1x length 20cm
* 1x length 30cm

The **30cm jumper cable is the one that needs to be used when putting together the Heliso4 Kit**. The 20cm one is a bit too short and can be discarded or used for other purposes.

Then regarding the color of the cable, **in each kit the color of the jumper cables may vary**. So it's normal if it doesn't match the colors you see in the wiki guide. The purpose of the different colors is just to help you check your wiring is correct since the pinout order is different between the board I2C header (J9) and the OLED header. Refer to this [OLED Assembly part B Section](https://wiki.kobol.io/kit/#oled-display-part-b) of the Assembly wiki page.
