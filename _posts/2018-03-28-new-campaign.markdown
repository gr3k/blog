It's been a little while since we have posted something on the blog, it's because we had to focus on our respective day jobs lately. We are very glad to have completed the 1st batch delivery, it was very tiring and time consuming, however we learned a lot to improve it for the next batch.

Our reward for such effort is to see now our backers enjoying their Helios4 setup. It really makes us feel we successfully achieved a big milestone. **So thanks again to all of you for your support and trust**.

All your feedbacks, emails and the size of our mailing list showed us how big the interest for Helios4 is. Obviously the 1st batch helped us to promote and spread the word about Helios4. We also received some bulk order requests. So all of this confirmed we had to do a new batch.

### We are happy to announce that we are now preparing our next campaign and we will start collecting orders next month. So stay tuned !

We will use the same Crowd-funding / BTO (Build to order) approach as we did. All Helios4 will still be **2GB ECC RAM**. We will limit the Full Kit casing to only one color (*Blue*) and introduce a **board-only option**.

#### We will broadcast an announcement as soon as the campaign is opened.

Meanwhile we are still working here and there to enhance the documentation and release more polished software.

To finish we wanted to thanks the [Armbian team](https://www.armbian.com) for the help ;-) If you are looking for an Open Source project to support then you should consider them... or us otherwise :P
