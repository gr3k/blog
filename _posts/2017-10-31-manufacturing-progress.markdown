We finally got a **progress update** on the **Helios4 boards manufacturing** (process handled by SolidRun).

1. A388 SoM manufacturing **ongoing** (See pictures below).
2. PCB carrier boards ETA from supplier : **9/11/2017**.
3. ETA for completion of 350pcs : **5/12/2017**.

So unfortunately you will realize that the schedule is shifing more than expected. Originally we hoped to start shipping end October or early November, now we know it will only happen **mid-December**.

We are sorry about the delay and we hope you will bear the wait a bit longer. As any first experience, we were a bit over optimistic for the 1st batch completion date. We didn't account enough buffer for the latency in the different back and forth discussions with the suppliers.   

It also generates a lot of frustration on our side because when you are manufacturing small batch of eletronics you don't have much leverage to push things. Plus a lot of steps require effort that is the same whichever is the size of your batch, so manufacturing only 350 units doesn't save time over a thousand.

All of this is a learning process for us. **We thank you all again for your support and patience !**
