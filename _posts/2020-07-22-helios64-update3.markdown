# Manufacturing Status

As shared recently on our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kobol_io) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/kobol.io/) pages, the first batch of **Helios64 boards is currently going through Factory Acceptance Test (FAT)**. This is the last step before the boards get packed and sent out to our warehouse for fulfillment. Our FAT procedure takes a bit of time since we tests all the interfaces & features of each board.

Regarding the Heliso64 Enclosure Kit, the manufacturing is complete. Now only remains to the factory to pack all the accessories of each enclosure kit and deliver them to our warehouse.

So in a nutshell, **all looks very good for shipping to start early August ;-)** And talking about shipping, please read carefully the following sections.

# Introducing DDP for EU customers

For EU customers **we are introducing Delivered Duty Paid (DDP)** where we collect directly duties and taxes to do the customs clearance for EU import on your behalf. This way it's fuzz free for you, no need to pay anything on delivery or worry about expensive admin fees some couriers charge for customs clearance.

We work out the following flat fee with our shipping partner that includes import duties+taxes AND shipping fees : USD 77 per Helios64 Full Bundle unit. This is a good deal taking in consideration the parcel weight (6.5 Kg) and the goods value.

In order to simplify logistic and fast track Helios64 shipping, **we decided to make this DDP option mandatory for all past and new pre-orders of the Helios64 Full Bundle made by EU customers**. If you have already made a pre-order, you will soon receive an electronic invoice from our system that will ask you to top-up USD 45 per unit corresponding to USD 77 minus what you paid already for shipping fees.

Here the list of the concerned countries :

| Austria | France | Latvia | Romania
| Belgium | Germany | Lithuania | Slovakia
| Bulgaria | Greece | Luxembourg | Slovenia
| Czech Republic | Hungary | Netherlands | Spain
| Denmark | Ireland | Poland | Sweden
| Estonia | Italy | Portugal | United Kingdom
| Finland |

# Check your shipping address !

Now that the order fulfillment phase is coming soon, this is the right time to **double check that your shipping address is correct and up to date**. Simply reply to the *order confirmation* email you received with any required change.

In case you cannot find your *order confirmation*, just email us to [support@kobol.io](https://shop.kobol.io/contact-us/) from the email address you used to make the pre-order and we will resend you the *order confirmation* email.
