We understand that all of you are looking forward to receiving your Helios4, but you will have to be a little more patient. Manufacturing of the PCB is still ongoing and schedule has shifted a little bit because of some components sourcing delay.

***We should be able to start shipping end of the month or early next month.***

Meanwhile you can have a look at the schematics. You will find them on the [**wiki**](https://wiki.kobol.io/docs) that is being developed for the Helios4 project.
