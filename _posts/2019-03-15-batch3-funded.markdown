**We revised a bit our inventory plan :** the quantity of units we will manufacture will be according to the total number of pre-ordered units collected by the end of the campaign date.

[**So if you want to get Helios4, you have until Sunday 24th March 2019 23:59 SGT to make your move. This is your last chance to order it.**](https://shop.kobol.io/collections/frontpage/products/helios4-full-kit-3rd-ecc-2nd-batch-pre-order)

Now we are getting ready to fire up manufacturing, and like previous campaigns we will keep you closely updated on the manufacturing progress.

**Big up to all :-)**
