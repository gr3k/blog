After working with the [Syncloud](https://syncloud.org/) team lately, we finally have the first official [Syncloud image](https://github.com/syncloud/platform/wiki) released for Helios4.

We have added a **[tutorial](https://wiki.kobol.io/syncloud/)** on our wiki on how to run and setup Syncloud for your Helios4.

**Note:** Syncloud doesn't have some of the tweaks and optimizations for ARM computer that you can find in Armbian. Hopefully they will improve this in future releases.
