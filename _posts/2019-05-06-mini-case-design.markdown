**Batch 3 manufacturing is progressing well**, in the meantime we are working on future projects and other little tasks here and there. So we finally found the time to design a **Helios4 Case for 2.5 inches drives** (HDD or SSD). The result is quite cool, making it roughly 30% smaller than the original 3.5 inches drives case.

**Note:** We won't offer the Mini Case on our shop, instead we are giving you the blue print of the case. It should be easy to manufacture it for couple of dozen bucks on any online laser cut service.
