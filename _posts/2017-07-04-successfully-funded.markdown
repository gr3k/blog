### Thank to all of you for showing such strong support.

Now we can finally focus on the exciting stuff and start the production of this first batch of 300++ units. We are really looking forward to making those little guys on the way to your home.

#### IMPORTANT :

For now on we will post progress updates here on our **KOBOL BLOG**

<u>Note:</u> Even though we reached our goal, we are still accepting pre-orders for this first batch till the end of campaign (July 19th 2017)
