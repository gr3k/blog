## Campaign Goal

We will use the same Pre-Order approach as we did for the 1st campaign. The goal is to **reach at least 500 orders** before starting production (350x Full Kits and 150x Basic Kits).

**Note:** You will get charged immediately when you order. If the campaign doesn't reach its funding goal by the end date (August 5th, 2018), you will get refunded the whole amount.

## Promotion

If you order 2 or more products, you can use the following discount codes during checkout.

| Discount                      | Code |
|-------------------------------|------|
| Buy 2 products and get 3% off | OFF3 |
| Buy 3 or more and get 5% off  | OFF5 |

## About Shipping

This time we will do our fulfillment from Hong Kong. We have found a warehouse company that will take care of Helios4 kitting, packaging and shipping. This will offload a lot of work from us, this way we can focus on the important tasks like software support.

This new warehouse approach limits our shipping options to door-to-door carrier only (UPS, Fedex, Depex, TNT, etc..). We are aware that they are not the cheapest carriers, however thanks to a special bulk deal, we offer the 2 following attractive shipping options for US and UK/Europe.
* DPD eParcel (for UK and some European countries)
* Seko Standard (for US)

Also we have chosen to **collect up-front the Duties and Taxes for your country when applicable**. This simplifies a lot custom clearing and avoid unexpected fees. It means **you won't have to pay any additional taxes or fees at delivery**.

## FCC / CE Certification

We are preparing the lab test procedures to get FCC and CE certifications. So this second batch will get the CE, FCC and RoHS markings.

## Bulk Order

If you are looking to order several units of the board only (MOQ: 10 pieces), please contact us directly [here](https://shop.kobol.io/pages/contact-us).

## What next ?

We will keep you updated of the campaign progress and will post updates about software upgrades and new integration.

**We thank you in advance for your trust and support. Let's cross fingers we reach our goal and beyond...**
