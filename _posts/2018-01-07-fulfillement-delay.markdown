We are facing a new delay because the heatsink manufacturer did a mistake. There was no choice but to request manufacturing of a new batch of heatsink which will only be delivered this coming week. So all of this is pushing our fulfillment to mid-Jan.

**Note :** This problem doesn't concern any of the orders we already sent since we used a previous stock of heatsink that didn't present the issue.

Sorry again for the delay. We are as frustrated as you.
