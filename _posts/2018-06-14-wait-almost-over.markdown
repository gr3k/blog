## We are finally close to the 2nd Helios4 campaign launch.

First, sorry if it did not start yet, I know you guys are getting impatient. As posted here and there in response to people wondering what was going on, I explained that during the last 3 months the team was focus on day jobs leaving us almost no free time... *"well we all need to make a living"*. However recently things turned out differently and after much thoughts I finally decided to drop everything and fully focus on Helios4. The intention is to use Helios4 project to bootstrap a little business around it and future similar products.

Anyway back to what matters the most to you guys, **the new campaign will start by end of the month.**

As already explained, we will use the same Pre-Order approach as we did for the 1st campaign. **The goal is to reach at least 500 orders before starting production.**

You will have the choice to order one of the 2 following options :

*  Helios4 2GB ECC Full Kit (limited to blue color only)
*  Helios4 2GB ECC Basic Kit (a.k.a board-only option)

Pricing wise, it will remain the same than 1st campaign, with obviously a lower price for the Basic Kit.

Regarding fulfillment and shipping, we will try this time to collect up-front the applicable Tax & Duty for your country in order to save you money from expensive handling fees.

**Voila, stay tuned... the wait is almost over.**

Beside the new campaign, there is also a lot of happening in term of software support lately thanks to awesome contributors :

* Kernel and U-Boot upstream support (Dennis Gilmore)
* FreeBSD support (Josua Mayer)
* OpenWRT support (Sascha Paunovic)

I will soon publish more detailed posts about each of those ongoing effort.
